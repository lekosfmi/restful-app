# RestfulApp

A simple demonstration of interaction between Angular with a restful node api.
You can view the app live here.

## Getting Started

Alternatively, you can follow these steps to start the app on your local
machine.



## Starting the Node Server

While in the root directory of the app, run `npm start dev` then navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/contacts`, and you should see an array of contact
objects in the form of a JSON object appear.

## Starting the Angular App

While the node server is running and on a different shell, run `ng serve`
to start the Angular app. You can navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to check
out the app.
